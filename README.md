# Fuse.FoodAppExample
 Food ordering application example. Inspired by [Yarik Zinkof's desing](https://pages.github.com/)
 This is not 100% implementation, because I couldn't find all needed assets. But it's quite close to original :smile: 

Was made in two variants:
- The [First](Observables/) was made by [Fuse's Observables](https://fuseopen.com/docs/fusejs/observable.html) way
- The [Second](ModelApi/) was made by [Fuse's ModelApi aka FuseJS](https://fuseopen.com/docs/fusejs-beta/fusejs.html) way

All assets were taken for free from Internet and all rights belongs to its creators.

For money value formatting was used free [Accounting.js](http://openexchangerates.github.io/accounting.js/) library.
